Features:
1. Multiple Sessions
    Modify the database, maintaining two databse, one for users and one for sessions.
    When the user login, logout, createsession, joinsession, leavesession, and sent private message (feature 2) only the user database is updated. Each user has a linked list of sessions.
    
    However, when the user demand a list or send a message broadcast to the session, the database for session is updated by looking into the user database. Each session has a linked list of users. Then it can give session list and broadcast to all user in the session on the session list.
    
2. Private message
    Three new MACROs are added in message.h PRIVATE, PRIVATE_ACK, and PRIVATE_NAK.
    When user send a private message using the format :<user to send to> <message content>, the server acknowledge this private message and send a new message to the other user. The other user then get to know the private message and the sender.
